            <img src="images/maxresdefault_(2).jpg" alt="maxresdefault" class = "main_pic">
    <p class="tet">The Jungle refers to any area of the map that is not a lane or part of either team's base, including the rival that divides it. Jungles rely on killing neutral mobs in the jungle to keep up with their laning teammates in terms of gold and experience.</p>
    <p class="tet">Jungles are in between the three lanes. These areas weave their way into the map so you can cut through to lanes without having to go back and around map areas.</p>
    <p class="tet">Jungle creeps are mirrored on both sides, and both teams can access the same number of camps on their side of the map. As mentioned, the extent to which a team has map control fluctuates depending on the objectives they secure. </p>
    <p class="tet">Jungles have monsters scattered in those areas and give you a faster way of gaining gold and exp for your hero. You can spend the waiting period for enemy minions to kill one of the jungle monsters. Just take note that more powerful monsters are spawned as the match goes on. They do, however, give you better and more powerful bonuses. If you're lucky, you may ever get a bonus specific for your hero's health, damage and ever defense. </p>
    <p class="tet">In a standard 5-on-5 game of Mobile Legends, 4 players on a team will be Laners, and 1 player will be a designated Jungler. Jungle Creeps exclusively showcase in Imperial Sanctuary Map. Jungle creeps are very strong in early game. The team shares the jungle from the top and bottom areas. Some heroes are very fasst at clearing jungles, especially Assassin and Marksman due to having taking the retribution battle spell and giving them buff in order to have brust damage.</p>
    <p class="tet">Take note that specific characters are better suited for jungle areas than others and even have gear builds specific for jungling so be sure that your character is well-suited for the area before charging in for the monster kill. </p>
    <p class="tet">The purpose of the jungle is to gain the buffs  such as Gold, Healing, and Blue Buff, etc. The monsters are scattered throughout the jungle area in order for you to kill in return for those loots and rewards. At the beginning of the match, the monsters and the Cyclone Eye are spawned at different periods. There are decent heroes that are better for jungling than other heroes with the help of jungling gear build or just jungling item. Creeps and Battlefield Field features are constituent of the Jungle. Creeps are classified into 3: Common, Elite, and Legend. Common Creeps give a medium buff such as Healing Buff, and Gold Buff. Elite Creeps give a role buff that increases the heroes' attributes and has a special innate. Legend Creeps have big HP bar, and then always spawn in the river.</p>
    <h4>Monster Respawns and Buffs</h4>
    <p class="tet">There are different types of monsters in Mobile Legends. Each of these monsters gives different amounts of gold, experience, and unique in-game buffs. It is vital for you to know the basics and advancements about these jungle monsters if you want to be a successful Jungler.</p>
    <h3>Creeps</h3>
    <h4>Common Creeps</h4>
    <p class="tet">There are numerous small monsters or creeps, scattered throughout the jungle. These are really easy to kill and do not give out any buffs and are naturally, good for gold and experience only. These monsters spawn after 1 minute and you can clear these camps often, to obtain more gold and experience. If you are killing these monsters, when the enemy push is farther away from your tower, you will get a bonus experience and gold.</p>

                <h3>Lithowanderer</h3>
                <p>The Lithowanderer is considered only as a common creep because it won't attack you but movess only at the designated path. It can be found in the bush near the river in each half of the middle lane. It will appear in first 35 s.  When it was killed, it will become a Walkie Grass and follow the killer for 120s. The Walkie Grass helps the allied target within the 6-unit range to restore 2% HP and Mana every second. To minions, restore 3% per second. It is very helpful for team fights.</p><h4>Story</h4><p>Due to the divine power of the King of Light in the Imperial Sanctuary, it seems that everything could have souls. Around the riverway, there lives a mysterious and mild creature, named Lithowanderer. However, because the Walkie Grass that is living on its back has a magic power of healing, the Lithowanderer is often brought into the battlefields of war.</p>

              <br>
              Rockursa doesn't give any buff, aside from little and a Healing Buff.
              This is also essential to clear from time to time. Players that usually clear jungle camp once the push is still far away from his tower generate more gold than a player that stays on his lane.

            <h3>Crab</h3>
              <p>There are 2 different types of crabs in early game. In first 45 s, it will show only little crab and will refresh within 15s. The normal size of crab will appear after 90s later and needs to refresh for 120 s.</p><p>
              Crab gives you a Gold Buff which will provide an extra gold every second in a limited time. Little Crab will appear first and then the crab. The developers added the Crab in previous versions in order to give players more impetus to compete for jungle control, as well as to reward teamwork. Due to the crab's position being far away from where players usually fight, he soon became largely ignored. In the new map they have given the crab a new life, he will now be more closely situated to the top and bottom lanes, they hope this will break up the monotony of the top and bottom laning phases, allowing players use the crab to snowball or chase a lead.</p>

        <h3>Cryoturtle</h3>
        <p>The Cryoturtle spawns within 3 minutes in the game time. It will reward all teammates with gold and EXP. It gives Turtle Buff to the last hitter after killing it. Its basic attack is ranged only and it shoots the sparkling ball and it deals short damage. Spawn location and countdown for Turtle are displayed 120 seconds before it spawns.</p>
        <h4>Story</h4>
        <p>Cryoturtles are the slowest energy creatures of the Imperial Sanctuary. As it's recorded in the Warrior's Scripts, Cryoturtles are covered with numerous priceless treasures, including gold and crystals. The most amazing thing about it is that it has signed a mystic contract with the Lord of the Temple of Heroes. The warriors believed that the Cryoturtles overlook the Temple of Heroes from the other side of the lake, which meant they were interlinked in some way. To be specific, they believed that Cryoturtles are the critical keys to awaken the Lord of the Temple.</p>
       <h3>Tips</h3>
       <p>Turtle gives you a decent amount of gold and experience and it is recommended to take it down, early on in the game, as everyone is much dependent on items at the start. As mentioned above, you and your team can earn a bunch of gold and EXP from the turtle. However, never attempt to take on the Turtle, alone. It is not that easy, and you should always work as a team or if you even see a teammate fighting a Turtle, you should always help them out and secure the kill. Turtle has a respawning time of 3 minutes and you should never miss a chance, to slay the Turtle.</p>

Lord spawns every 4 minutes in a random location after he is killed for the first time. He has more attack skills than The Turtle, with his basic attack using his cudgel to hit the enemies, and it includes a bit of AoE where the direct impact isn't imminent.</p>
      <h4>History</h4>
      <p>His old appearance is similar to Tigreal's Dark Guardian skin but with a dark helmet on. With its new appearance, lord now has a more giant lava-theme devil and what seems to be steel or iron armor, lava horns on its head, and yellow eyes. it's shown wearing armor and its chest has flowing lava on it. Lord does not seem to have armor on the lower parts of his arms. His current ppearance is very similar to Hylos' model, Centaur.</p>
      <h4>Story</h4>
     <p>Legend has it that there is a mysterious creature hidden in the ancient Imperial Sanctuary, symbolizing power, victory, and destruction. The Lord of the Temple of Heroes, possesses the supreme power to endow everything on the battlefield with strength and make himself literally immortal. No one can be compared to him and even the bravest of fighters could only seek shelter from him, for a fairly short period. For a long time, the Lord of the Temple of Heroes posted here. Once awaken, he would be the most steadfast defense within the Imperial Sanctuary<p>

            <p>Lord is the most powerful of all monsters any your team must tackle it, only in the late game. It is recommended that the Lord must be slain when your team is powerful enough, otherwise, Lord will kill almost every one of your team member, due to its sheer strength. When your team finally manages to slay Lord, it will give you additional experience points and also add gold. Additionally, it will also start to fight, for your side. However, the Lord becomes weak if faced with multiple minions and enemy heroes, so you must clear a path and push it towards the opposition turrets. Never attempt to slay the Lord, alone, especially right when it spawns after 9 minutes, in-match time, because not only will it be suicide, but also, the turrets will most-likely kill it, before it can deal massive amounts of damage. Instead, make sure at least 2 turrets are gone on either lane before you summon Lord to fight alongside your team. Additionally, every time the Lord spawns, it is more powerful than before. So it is wise, to protect it from enemies, as your team tries to slay it. Otherwise, wait for the enemy to tackle it and then move in for the last hit, and secure the kill. Once the Lord is slain, there is a 4-minute cooldown, before it spawns again.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Summary</h3>
<p>Jungling is a reference to when you leave the lane, stay in the jungle to level up and help your teammates by doing occasional surprise attacks, during group fights. The basic idea here is that your team will be relying on you for game ganking. You should always be on the move, clearing jungle camps after camp and looking for opportunities to gank. Constantly check the minimap and try to camp at the lane nearest to the current objective to secure it more easily.</p>
